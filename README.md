# XojoPack

A package manager software for XOJO code. 

<hr/>

This project aims to create a software solution which allows to establish a software package repository for XOJO based components (mainly Modlues).

## Concept

This solution can be used to store/restore XOJO components (mainly Modules) into/from a centraliazed repository. Components can be "imported" into existing XOJO projects from the central repository by Copy&Paste. This approach allows the XOJO IDE to integrate the component correctly.

## Conditions and Limitation

## Current State

There is a client app avaliable, which allows to use a locally hosted file-based repository. The app can be used to scan an exsiting XOJO poject for Modules that are avaialble at the repository and checks the version of the Project Module agains the repository version.

A server app is currently not available.
